# 51mpl3r W3b

A project to make the development of websites a little easier, and above all simpler.

Tools to be developed:
+ A dependency injection tool
+ A template injection tool
+ More crazy injection tools? No
+ A  javascript code optimization tool

### Why the name "51mpl3r W3b"?

Simple, why not start the project to accomplish something, with what you feel about it.
No, I don't feel the development of websites is for code ninjas, or leet hackers. 
I simply feel, nowadays we have come to make it so. Only those minds, might understand
how the peversion of the web design has spread.


### Why make this project?

To develop a simple and good website, I believe, as in anything I put my mind on, in the use
and understanding of simple tools. So trash all that fancy IDE's, and funny business editors
and get cracking. 

The question is "How can I develop simple and readable static pages?"

The interesting word is static, once we use the very beautiful dynamic nature of the browsers
to build this utopia.

### What is this static nature you speak of?

Each page indeed is dynamic in nature, but the use is to establish a static environment, not the
SPA model, or any animation funny business, I like to speak of. The goal is to optimize the reuse
of templates, and resources in a "sane" way. I found myself laughing, because of the ludicrous 
assumptions, of a crazy mind.
